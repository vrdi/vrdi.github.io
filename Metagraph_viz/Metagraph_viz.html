<center><p id="paragraph1">At the Voting Rights Data Institute, we have lots of different ways to draw voting districts. 
For the visualization on this webpage, the rules are there must be three districts and each district must be made up of three contiguous units (basically, each district looks like a tetris piece),
and these districts are laid out on a three-by-three grid. There turns out to be 10 ways of doing this.
</p></center>

<center><p id="paragraph1">We can impose a graph or network structure to organize the collection of all of those 
    10 districting options. We'll let each valid plan be represented by a node in this network, and we'll connect 
    two nodes with an edge if the plans they represent are related by a simple swap move, exchanging the district assignments 
    of two cells from adjacent districts.
</p></center>

<center><p id="paragraph1">We call this structure the metagraph of districting plans. For a full explanation of the metagraph of districting plans, please visit https://mggg.org/metagraph/ .
</p></center>

<center><p id="paragraph1">The visualization below displays interactive metagraphs of districting plans. Each node is a districting plan, and you can click a node to highlight all of its neighbors.</p></center>

<center><p id="paragraph1">When you mouse over a node in the metagraph, you can see the corresponding districting plan. 
    The data format is a left-to-right, top-to-bottom linearization of the partition.
    For a districting plan with numbers listed as 1,1,1,2,2,3,2,3,3, for example, the partition is 
</p></center>


<center><p class="small">
        1 1 1<br>
        2 2 3<br>
        2 3 3<br>
</p></center>

<center><p id="paragraph1">where the same number represents the three contiguous units in the same districts. 
    The nodes are colored by the number of degree (or number of neighbors). 
    The number of edges in this metagraph is 16;
    the radius (the minimum value of all maximum distances from any node to all other nodes) is 3;
    the diameter (the maximum value of all maximum distances from any node to all other nodes) is 3;
    the number of centers (the set of nodes with maximum distance to all other nodes equal to radius) is 10.
